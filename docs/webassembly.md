### Compiling C/C++ to WebAssembly

Browsers don't know how to run C code.
WebAssembly is a W3C standard to facilitate high-performance applications on web pages.
You can compile C/C++ into WebAssembly using a tool like Emscripten.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```sh
emcc hello.c -o hello.html
```

At this point in your source directory you should have:
    The binary Wasm module code: hello.wasm
    A JS file containing glue code to translate between the native C functions and JS: hello.js
    An HTML file to load, compile, and instantiate your Wasm code in the browser: hello.html

### Compiling to JavaScript

Emscripten requires a large variety of JavaScript "glue" code to handle memory allocation, memory leaks, and a host of other problems.

```sh
emcc -o hello.js hello.c -O3
```
You could then incorporate this JavaScript file into your program. In your app's entry module, add:

```js
import "./hello.js";
```

Alternatively, you can produce a factory module, which allows you to produce multiple instances of the module (by default the glue code loads the module globally, causing multiple instances to collide).

* If your output file extension is .js and not .mjs, then you have to add the -sEXPORT_ES6 setting to output a JavaScript module.

```sh
emcc -o hello.mjs hello.c -O3 -sMODULARIZE -sEXPORT_ES6
```

Then in your code import the factory and call it:

```js
import createModule from "./hello.mjs";

createModule().then((Module) => {
  console.log("Wasm ready", Module);
});
```

### Calling a custom function defined in C

If you want to call a function defined in your C code from JavaScript, you can use the Emscripten ccall() function and the EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE declaration, which adds your functions to the exported functions list.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <emscripten/emscripten.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World\n");
    return 0;
}

#ifdef __cplusplus
#define EXTERN extern "C"
#else
#define EXTERN
#endif

EXTERN EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE void myFunction(int argc, char ** argv) {
    printf("MyFunction Called\n");
}
```

By default, Emscripten-generated code always just calls the main() function, and other functions are eliminated as dead code. Putting EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE before a function name stops this from happening. You also need to import the emscripten.h library to use EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE.

* We are including the #ifdef blocks so that if you are trying to include this in C++ code, the example will still work. Due to C versus C++ name mangling rules, this would otherwise break, but here we are setting it so that it treats it as an external C function if you are using C++.

```sh
emcc -o hello.js hello.c -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 -s "EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=['ccall']" -s MODULARIZE -s EXPORT_ES6
```

* Note that we need to compile with NO_EXIT_RUNTIME: otherwise, when main() exits, the runtime would be shut down and it wouldn't be valid to call compiled code. This is necessary for proper C emulation: for example, to ensure that atexit() functions are called.

You need to run the new myFunction() function from JavaScript. 

Add a <button> element to your html.

```html
<button id="my-button">Run myFunction</button>
```
Add the following code at the end of the first <script> element:

```js
document.getElementById("my-button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("check console");
  const result = Module.ccall(
    "myFunction", // name of C function
    null, // return type
    null, // argument types
    null, // arguments
  );
});
```
This illustrates how ccall() is used to call the exported function.
