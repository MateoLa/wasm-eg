<h3>Running C/C++ in the Browser</h3>

<p>WebAssembly examples</p>

</div>


#### WebAssembly 

Wasm is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. The code can be run in modern browsers to run compiled codes like C++, Rust, Go, etc. on the client.

WebAssembly is designed to complement and run alongside JavaScript, sharing functionality between them.


#### Prerequisites

Install GCC/g++ compilers required to compile C++ programs in Linux

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Install or Update Emscripten

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git  --> download Emscripten if you haven't already

cd emsdk
./emsdk update  --> update Emscripten is you already have it installed
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest  --> configuration files
source ./emsdk_env.sh  --> set Emscripten into your current console

emcc -v
emcc --version
```


#### Hello World Example

In a browser we going to run the main() C++ function in hello.cpp.

```sh
emcc hello.cpp -o hello.html --emrun
emrun hello.html
```

emcc, the Emscripten compiler, compiles hello.cpp into a binary `hello.wasm` file which is instantiated by `hello.js` glue code.

emrun is a local web sever and test tool used to host and launch the compliled html and WebAssembly files.

And that's it. We are using hello.js glue code to run C code into the browser.


### Calling C/C++ functions from Javascript

#### Ping Pong example

<h4>Ping Pong example</h4>

</div>

From a Ping-Pong game entirely in JS (/original/pong.js), we will migrate some functions to pong.cpp and use them from there.

To do this, we will use a tool called embind (part of the Emscripten toolchain, --bind option)

```sh
emcc pong.cpp -o pong_wasm.js --std=c++17 --bind
emrun pong.html --no_emrun_detect
```

The directory structure is as follows:
  - /original, the ping-pong game in its original JS and html files.
  - /start, the initial modifications to make the wasm module work
  - /embind_classes, C++ functions and classes that can be linked with Emscripten 
  - /final, 

The JS glue code `pong_wasm.js` instantiates a variable `Module` which enables the use of the functions and classes defined in C/C++.<br>
Read the first comments in any glue code to learn how to use this variable.<br>
Here we use the 4th option. In `pong.html` we define the Module variable to execute render(). Then the glue code adds to it all the C++ functions and classes we going to use.

Note also that pong.html use Emscripten event `onRuntimeInitialized` to delay function calls until the Wasm artifact is fully loaded.
